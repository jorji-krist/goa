About 350,000 people live on its 2,880 km2 (1,110 sq mi). <br>

        Adjara is home to the Adjarians, a regional subgroup of Georgians. <br> The name can be spelled in a number of ways: Ajara, Ajaria, Adjaria, Adzharia, Atchara and Achara. <br> Under the Soviet Union, Adjara was part of the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic as the Adjarian ASSR.[5] The autonomous status of Adjara is guaranteed under article 6 of the Treaty of Kars.</h2></p>
