    <h2 class="h1st">Key Components of Integrated Healthcare</h2>
    <p>
        1. Person-Centered Care: Integrated healthcare focuses on the individual, considering their physical, mental, <br>
        and social well-being. Treatment plans are tailored to the patient’s unique circumstances, values, and preferences. <br> <br>

        2. Coordination of Services: Strong communication between providers ensures that care is continuous and consistent. <br>
        Electronic health records (EHRs) and shared information systems are often used to facilitate this coordination. <br>

        3. Interdisciplinary Teams: Integrated healthcare relies on teams of professionals from diverse disciplines, <br>
        working collaboratively to address the broad spectrum of a patient’s needs. <br> <br>

        4. Preventative and Community-Based Services: By including preventive care and addressing social <br>
        determinants of health (e.g., housing, nutrition, and education), integrated healthcare extends its <br>
        reach beyond traditional medical interventions.

    <h2> Benefits of Integrated Healthcare</h2>
    <p class="p1">
        1. Improved Patient Outcomes: Patients benefit from comprehensive and personalized care <br>
        plans that address all aspects of their health. This reduces the risk of gaps in care, <br>
        misdiagnoses, or conflicting treatments. <br><br>

        2. Enhanced Efficiency: By eliminating redundant tests, procedures, and fragmented care, <br>
        integrated healthcare reduces costs and streamlines the delivery process. <br> <br>

        3. Better Management of Chronic Conditions: Integrated care is particularly beneficial for <br>
        individuals with chronic illnesses or complex health needs, as it ensures that all aspects <br>
        of their condition are managed collaboratively. <br><br>

        4. Focus on Prevention: Preventative care is a cornerstone of integrated systems, <br>
        helping to reduce the incidence and severity of illnesses. <br><br>

        5. Holistic Approach: By addressing mental, social, and environmental factors alongside <br>
        physical health, integrated healthcare promotes overall well-being.

    <p>
        Public healthcare systems are fundamental to ensuring equitable access to medical services, <br>
        promoting societal well-being, and addressing public health challenges on a large scale. <br>
        These systems are designed to provide comprehensive healthcare services to populations, often <br>
        funded and regulated by governments to uphold healthcare as a universal right rather than a privilege. <br>
        Their structure, funding models, and outcomes vary globally, reflecting the diverse approaches <br>
        societies take to address health needs. <br><br><br>
    </p>

    
    <h2>Key Features of Public Healthcare</h2>
    <p>
        At its core, public healthcare is characterized by its emphasis on accessibility, <br>
        equity, and preventative care. It is primarily funded through taxation or social health <br>
        insurance contributions, enabling the government to provide medical services either for <br>
        free or at heavily subsidized rates. This ensures that individuals can access essential <br>
        healthcare services regardless of their socioeconomic status. Unlike private healthcare systems <br>
        that prioritize profit, public healthcare systems focus on collective well-being, often allocating <br>
        resources to underserved or vulnerable populations. <br> <br>

        An integral component of public healthcare is its focus on prevention and early intervention. <br>
        Vaccination campaigns, health education programs, and disease screenings are often central to these systems, <br>
        aiming to reduce the prevalence of preventable diseases and minimize long-term healthcare costs. <br>
        By prioritizing public health initiatives, these systems address the root causes of <br>
        health disparities and promote healthier lifestyles.
