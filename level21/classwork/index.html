                <h2>
                    <p style="color: rgb(34, 32, 32)">Christmas is an annual festival commemorating the birth of Jesus
                        Christ, observed primarily on December 25[a] as a religious and cultural celebration among
                        billions of people around the world. A feast central to the liturgical year in Christianity, it
                        follows the season of Advent (which begins four Sundays before) or the Nativity Fast, and
                        initiates the season of Christmastide, which historically in the West lasts twelve days and
                        culminates on Twelfth Night. Christmas Day is a public holiday in many countries, is celebrated
                        religiously by a majority of Christians, as well as culturally by many non-Christians, and forms
                        an integral part of the holiday season surrounding it. <br> <br> <br> <br>

                        The traditional Christmas narrative recounted in the New Testament, known as the Nativity of
                        Jesus, says that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. When
                        Joseph and Mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room, and so they were offered a stable
                        where the Christ Child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds, who then
                        spread the word. <br> <br> <br> <br>

                        There are different hypotheses regarding the date of Jesus's birth, and in the early fourth
                        century, the church fixed the date as December 25. It is exactly nine months after Annunciation
                        on March 25, also the date of the spring equinox. Most Christians celebrate on December 25 in
                        the Gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in
                        countries throughout the world. <br> <br> <br> <br>
                        
                        However, part of the Eastern Christian Churches celebrate
                        Christmas on December 25 of the older Julian calendar, which currently corresponds to January 7
                        in the Gregorian calendar. For Christians, believing that God came into the world in the form of
                        man to atone for the sins of humanity rather than knowing Jesus's exact birth date is considered
                        to be the primary purpose of celebrating Christmas.
